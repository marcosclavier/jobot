Job Application Bot PRD
1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
This Product Requirements Document outlines the specifications for an AI-powered Job Application Bot designed to assist users in finding and applying for jobs. Leveraging advanced AI models (e.g., generative AI like Gemini), the bot will intelligently recommend relevant job listings for user review, evaluate job fit using AI-driven analysis, generate tailored application materials, allow users to review and edit these materials, and submit applications upon user approval. The AI-centric approach emphasizes natural language processing (NLP), machine learning for matching, and generative capabilities to provide personalized, efficient job search assistance.

1.2 Scope
The Job Application Bot will:

Collect and process user profile information (e.g., resume, skills, preferences) using AI for parsing and enhancement.
Utilize AI to search for, filter, and recommend job listings based on user criteria, including real-time evaluation of job fit.
Present AI-recommended jobs to the user for review and selection, with explanations generated by AI.
Generate tailored application materials (e.g., cover letters, resume adjustments) using generative AI models.
Allow users to review and edit AI-generated application answers and files before submission.
Submit applications to job portals or employer systems upon user approval.
Provide AI-driven status updates and insights on application submissions, such as predictive success probabilities.
The bot will operate on platforms such as web and mobile apps, integrating with job boards, APIs, and AI services (e.g., Gemini API for evaluation and generation). The bot will not apply to jobs directly or automatically; all steps require user review and approval. The core implementation will be in a main script (bot.py) that handles AI integrations, job fetching, and evaluations.

2. Features and Functionality
2.1 User Profile Creation
Description: Users input their resume, skills, work experience, education, and job preferences (e.g., location, industry, salary range). AI will parse and enhance the profile for better matching.

Requirements:

Support for resume upload (PDF, DOCX) or manual input, with AI-based parsing (e.g., using NLP to extract skills and experience).
Fields for job preferences: job title, industry, location (remote, city, etc.), salary expectations, and work type (full-time, part-time, contract).
AI enhancement: Use generative AI to suggest additional skills or refine preferences based on profile analysis.
Secure storage of user data with encryption.
Option to update profile at any time, with AI detecting changes and re-optimizing recommendations.
2.2 Job Search and Recommendation
Description: The bot uses AI to search job boards (e.g., Adzuna, LinkedIn, Indeed) and recommends relevant jobs based on user profile and preferences, incorporating AI evaluation of full job descriptions.

Requirements:

Integration with job board APIs (e.g., Adzuna API) for real-time job listings, with AI handling query optimization (e.g., keyword expansion using synonyms).
AI-driven matching algorithm to rank jobs by relevance (based on skills, experience, preferences, and fit scores from generative AI models like Gemini).
Fetch and scrape full job descriptions concurrently, using AI to summarize and evaluate fit (e.g., scoring on a 1-10 scale with explanations).
Recommendations presented in a user-friendly interface with filters (e.g., by date, location, salary, AI fit score).
Each recommendation includes job title, company, location, salary (if available), a brief AI-generated summary, and fit explanation.
Users can select or reject recommended jobs for further action; no application materials are generated without user selection.
Limit searches to recent jobs (e.g., last 15 days) and manage seen jobs to avoid duplicates.
2.3 Job Recommendation Review
Description: Users review AI-recommended job listings before the bot proceeds with application preparation, with AI providing personalized insights.

Requirements:

Display recommended jobs in a dashboard with options to view full job details and AI-generated fit explanations.
Allow users to mark jobs as "Interested," "Not Interested," or "Save for Later."
Provide an AI summary of why the job was recommended (e.g., skill match percentages, location alignment, generated via NLP analysis).
Enable batch selection for multiple jobs to proceed to application preparation.
Ensure that only user-selected jobs advance to material generation; no automated progression.
AI feedback loop: Use user selections to fine-tune future recommendations.
2.4 Application Material Generation
Description: For jobs marked as "Interested," the bot uses generative AI to create tailored application materials, such as cover letters and customized resumes, based on the full job description and user profile.

Requirements:

AI-generated cover letters tailored to job descriptions and user profile, using models like Gemini for natural, persuasive content.
Resume adjustments via AI to highlight relevant skills and experience, with keyword optimization for ATS compatibility.
Support for answering job-specific application questions (e.g., "Why do you want to work here?") using generative AI.
Materials generated in editable formats (e.g., DOCX, text).
Generation occurs only after user review and selection of jobs, with options for AI regeneration based on user prompts.
2.5 Application Review and Editing
Description: Users review and edit AI-generated application materials and answers before submission, with AI assistance for improvements.

Requirements:

Present generated materials in an editable interface (e.g., web-based text editor).
Highlight key sections (e.g., cover letter, resume, application questions) for easy review, with AI suggestions for enhancements.
Allow users to modify text, upload new files, or regenerate specific sections using AI.
Provide a preview of how the application will appear to employers, including AI-simulated ATS scoring.
Option to save drafts for later review.
Validation to ensure required fields (e.g., mandatory questions) are completed, with AI flagging potential issues.
No submission proceeds without user completion of this review step.
2.6 Application Submission
Description: Upon user approval after reviewing jobs and application materials, the bot submits applications to the respective job portals or employer systems.

Requirements:

Submit applications only after explicit user confirmation (e.g., "Submit" button) following all review steps.
Support for submission via job board APIs or email where applicable.
Handle file uploads (e.g., resume, cover letter) in required formats.
Provide confirmation of successful submission with a timestamp and job details.
Notify users of any submission errors and allow resubmission after corrections.
