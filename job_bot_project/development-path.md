  Step-by-Step Development Path

  Here are the four major phases to build this system:

  Phase 1: Build the Web Portal and Backend Foundation

  The first step is to create the core web application and user management system.

   1. Expand the Backend API (FastAPI):
       * User Authentication: Implement a user registration and login system. When a user logs in, the backend will provide
         them with an authentication token (like a JWT), which proves who they are for future requests.
       * Create API Endpoints:
           * POST /api/register: To create a new user account.
           * POST /api/login: To authenticate a user and get a token.
           * POST /api/cv-upload: An endpoint that accepts a CV file upload.

   2. Create the Frontend Web Portal:
       * Build simple HTML pages for:
           * A registration page.
           * A login page.
           * A main dashboard page where the user can upload their CV.
       * Write the JavaScript to handle form submissions to your new API endpoints.

   3. Integrate CV Parsing:
       * When a user uploads a CV to the /api/cv-upload endpoint, the backend will trigger the existing parse_resume and
         enhance_profile_with_gemini functions.
       * The extracted profile data will then be saved to a database, associated with that specific user's account.

  Phase 2: Implement Job Matching and the Portal Dashboard

  Now that you have users and profiles, you can find and display jobs for them.

   1. Adapt the Job Matching Logic:
       * The existing search() logic from main.py will be moved into a backend service.
       * This service will periodically run for each user, find job matches based on their profile, and save these matches to
         the database.

   2. Create New API Endpoints:
       * GET /api/matches: For the web portal to fetch the list of matched jobs for the logged-in user.
       * POST /api/matches/{job_id}/apply: When the user clicks "Apply," the portal will call this endpoint. The backend will
         simply record that the user wants to apply and return the direct URL to the job application page.
       * DELETE /api/matches/{job_id}: To remove a job match from the user's dashboard.

   3. Enhance the Portal Dashboard:
       * The dashboard will fetch jobs from /api/matches and display them in a list.
       * Each job will have an "Apply" button that, when clicked, opens the job application page in a new tab. It will also
         have a "Remove" button.

  Phase 3: Overhaul the Chrome Extension

  The extension needs to be rewired to talk to the new backend instead of using local files.

   1. Implement Authentication in the Extension:
       * The extension's options page will be changed. Instead of a file loader, it will have a text box where the user can
         paste the authentication token they get from logging into the web portal. This securely links the extension to their
         user account.

   2. Fetch Profile Data from the API:
       * When the user clicks "Fill Form," the popup.js script will no longer look in chrome.storage for manually loaded
         data.
       * Instead, it will make an authenticated request to a new backend endpoint (e.g., GET /api/me/profile) to get the
         user's profile data directly from the database.

  Phase 4: Implement On-Demand Document Generation

  This is the final and most powerful piece of the workflow.

   1. Create a Document Generation API Endpoint:
       * Build a new endpoint, for example: POST /api/jobs/{job_id}/generate-documents.
       * This endpoint will use the user's profile and the specific job's details to call the existing
         generate_refined_resume and generate_application_materials functions on the backend.
       * Instead of saving files to disk, it will return the generated resume and cover letter text directly in the API
         response.

   2. Update the Extension's "Fill Form" Logic:
       * When the user clicks "Fill Form" on a job page, the extension will now perform a two-step process:
           1. It will first call the /api/jobs/{job_id}/generate-documents endpoint to get the tailored CV and cover letter.
           2. It will then proceed to fill the form using the user's profile data and the newly generated text.

   3. Handle File Uploads (The Tricky Part):
       * Important: For security reasons, a Chrome extension cannot programmatically select a local file for an upload field.
       * Solution: When the extension gets the generated CV/Cover Letter text, it can present it to the user in a new tab or
         allow them to easily copy it. The user would then need to quickly save it as a .docx or .pdf file and select it
         manually in the upload dialog. This is a minor but necessary manual step in an otherwise automated workflow.

  By following these phases, you can systematically build the sophisticated, user-friendly job application portal you've
  envisioned.
